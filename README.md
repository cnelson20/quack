# quack

Quack is a puzzle game inspired by the Dr. Mario series of games, for  the Commander X16 computer

You can download the game and play it online on the official X16 forums here: [https://cx16forum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6775](https://cx16forum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6775)

The sound code uses a fork of MooingLemur's [zsmkit](https://github.com/mooinglemur/zsmkit) library, created by me.
Graphics were created by AJenbo, many thanks to both of them.
